# Challenger ROM disassembly

The Opus Challenger 3-in-1 was a combined disc interface, disc drive
and RAM disc for the BBC Micro.

This repo exists to provide a disassembly of the Challenger 2.00 ROM,
the last ROM made for it, and to provide a patched version suitable
for use with a BBC B (since as supplied it effectively only works on
the BBC Master).

The current disassembly is the raw output from
[da65](https://cc65.github.io/doc/da65.html), with meaningful labels
and (hopefully) most of the code and data separated out. Once I'm
happy this bit all makes sense, I'll probably start working on it by
hand, making it [64tass](http://tass64.sourceforge.net/)-friendly,
adding comments, adding appropriate org directives for the NMI
routines, turning absolute addresses into label-relative offsets when
necessary, adding `<` and `>` operators where appropriate, and so
on...

# Patched 2.00 ROM

The Challenger 2.00 DFS ROM sort-of works on its own in a BBC B, but
doesn't initialise properly without the ADFS ROM, effectively making
it Master-only (and going by the code I actually suspect it wouldn't
work on its own even then). The patched version fixes this. Full list
of changes:

* initialise DFS properly on reset
* tidy up wonky `*CAT` output
* advertises itself as version `200B`

The patched ROM image is in the repo as `beeb/chaldis/1/R.PCH200`.

**Use at your own risk**! - I do use this patched ROM in my BBC B
myself, and no problems noted so far, but I don't store anything
important on discs...

The patched ROM should work on the Master, with or without the ADFS
part, but I haven't tested this yet.

# Repo layout

## `101`

Quick disassembly of the Challenger 1.01 ROM - see
[`CH101_da65.asm`](./101/CH101_da65.asm). (There is a later 1.03 ROM,
but 1.01 is the one that my BBC Micro happened to have, so I decided
to go with that.)

Not sure how far I'm going to go with this - so far, it's for
comparison to the 2.00 ROM only.

## `200`

Disassembly of Challenger 2.00 ROM. The ROM is 32K, so it's in two
parts - see [`CH200_da65.asm`](./200/CH200_da65.asm) and
[`CHADFS_da65.asm`](./200/CHADFS_da65.asm).

## `beeb`

[BeebLink](https://github.com/tom-seddon/beeblink) volume holding some
test programs and the patched 2.00 ROM for use with BBC B.

## `originals`

Original ROMs, random Slogger advert pic, and anything else I find.

## `tools`

Tools for use on PC. So far, just the ROM patcher that makes the BBC B
version of Challenger 2.00.

# Building

The build outputs are in the repo already, so you only need to do this
if you're going to modify something...

Prerequisites:

* [da65](https://cc65.github.io/doc/da65.html)
* Python 2.x on PATH
* Perl 5.x on PATH
* Some kind of Unix with all the usual Unix stuff (I use Mac OS X)

The build process does the following:

* run da65 to generate initial Challenger 1.01 disassembly (outputs
  `./101/CH101_da65.asm`)
* run da65 to generate initial Challenger 2.00 disassembly (outputs
  `./200/CH200_da65.asm` and `./200/CHADFS_da65.asm`)
* run Perl to paste [Greg Cook's comments](http://regregex.bbcmicro.net/chal200.asm.txt)
  into the Challenger 2.00 disassembly
* run `./tools/patch_ch200.py` to generate patched Challenger 2.00 ROM
  for use on BBC B (outputs `./beeb/chaldis/1/R.PCH200`)

Type `make` to run it.

(Once I start hand-editing the disassembly, these build steps will
become mostly redundant.)
